%\section{Research}
%%\cvlistitem{\textbf{NetBricks}}: 
%%\cvlistitem {\textbf{ZCSI}: Network operators are increasingly moving from hardware middleboxes to software network
%%functions. The move to software reduces vendor lock-in, makes it easier to deploy new features, and provides benefits
%%for consolidation. The current model for deploying these network functions envisions using virtual machines (or
%%containers) connected using virtual switches. While this model has served workloads in the cloud well, NFs need to
%%process millions of packets per-second while adding no more than a few microseconds of delay in order to meet SLAs. VMs
%%and containers add high-overheads for this. ZCSI is a new NF framework which leverages software isolation to provide the
%%same guarantees as VMs without incurring this overhead. Furthermore, ZCSI allows NFs to be written in high-level, safe
%%languages, enhancing developer productivity and allowing faster development. ZCSI achieves this while improving
%%performance when compared to today's deployments.}

%%\cvlistitem {\textbf{NetBricks}: The use of ZCSI requires that NFs be rewritten. Writing an NF today requires that NF
%%writers spend a great deal of time implementing and optimizing many basic building blocks (e.g., algorithms that split
%%packets across cores, cache-aware data structures to reduce cross-core contention, etc.). However these building blocks
%%are not easily generalized, the optimizations within these blocks is dependent on the algorithm being implemented, and
%%design choices for other building blocks. NetBricks is a new framework for NFV where NFs are specified using a data flow
%%graph whose nodes are drawn from a fixed set provided by the framework. This enables NetBricks to perform automatic
%%reasoning and optimization, freeing the NF developer from these concerns.}

%\cvlistitem {\textbf{BESS}: The Berkeley Extensible Software Switch is a virtual switch that has been specifically
%optimized for NFV deployments. It is written to allow easy extensibility (allowing custom modules to be run), and offers
%significant performance improvements over existing solutions like OpenVSwitch.}

%\cvlistitem {\textbf{E2}: The move to NFV makes it essential that we build and provide tools for managing how NFs are
%run and scaled in a cluster. E2 is a system that manages this, it builds on top of BESS (which is used to detect cases
%where an individual NF is overloaded, and scale the NF as appropriate). E2 also provides support for NF fault tolerance
%(through the use of FTMB), and allows operators to enforce QoS requirements, etc.}

%\cvlistitem {\textbf{Model Checking for Networks}: Networks include middleboxes and other stateful elements whose
    %behavior is dictated by previously encountered packets. We developed a tool to verify isolation invariants (can
    %packets with certain characteristics be delivered to certain end hosts, and can data originating at a particular
    %host end up somewhere). We also developed theoretical foundations showing that if one uses middlebox models with
    %certain simple limitations and runs checks in loop free network then verification is guaranteed to terminate.}

%\cvlistitem {\textbf{Data-Aware Cluster Scheduling for Sampling Jobs}: An increasing portion of cluster computing jobs
%use sampled data, either to reduce computational time using approximate querying or when computing stochastic machine
%learning functions. In this work, we looked at how cluster schedulers could use sampling information to significantly
%improve the performance of cluster computing jobs.}

%\cvlistitem {\textbf{Network Consistency Models}: Networks increasingly enforce policy, which ultimately requires that
%several of the middleboxes/routers in a network have a consistent view of the network. However, the CAP theorem says
%that this must necessarily come at the cost of giving up availability in the presence of partitions. In this work we
%analyzed the effects of this trade-off.}

%\cvlistitem {\textbf{Data Driven Connectivity}: Minimizing the network disruption due to link or router/switch failures
    %continues to be an important concern.
    %We developed an online algorithm that provides perfect forwarding
%resilience \textit{i.e.,} guarantees that in an uncongested, connected network no set of link failures results in a packet drop. We
%have also had subsequent work on theory that shows the limits of resilience that can be achieved using just static
%routing tables with no updates.}

%\cvlistitem {\textbf{SDNv2}: The rise of NFV and other similar technologies has meant that general purpose computers are
%increasingly available at the network edge. We designed a new internet architecture that allowed ISPs to leverage these
%computers to provide increased flexibility to the customers.}

%\cvlistitem {\textbf{SMIRC}: We asked the question, can secure multiparty computation (SMPC) can be used to compute BGP
%routing information. The use of SMPC would allows BGP computation to be centralized without requiring ASes to reveal
%private policy information, speeding up BGP convergence without requiring ASes to change their trust model.}

%\cvlistitem {\textbf{Recursive SDN}: We looked at how one could scale SDN controllers so they can be used to control ISP
    %networks which tend to both be numerically larger, and geographically wide-spread. Our solution is to use hierarchy
    %and recursive algorithms.}


    %\cvlistitem {\textbf{BlinkDB}: We built a fast, approximate database on top of Spark. BlinkDB used sampling and
    %innovative statistical techniques to provide approximate answers and quality measurements for arbitrary SQL query.
%BlinkDB has since been deployed at companies like Facebook, is commercially supported by other companies.}

%\cvlistitem {\textbf{Symmetry Breaking for Constraint Programming}: We looked at methods by which one could speed up
%solving constraint satisfaction problems. These problems are widely used (for instance to schedule UPS delivery trucks
%and NFL games) and are susceptible to an exponential growth in time, particularly when many equivalent (symmetric)
%solutions exist. }
