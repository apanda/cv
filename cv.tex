\section{Interests}
I am interested in the architecture and implementation of large distributed systems (including large computation clusters and
computer networks).

\section{Research}
\cvlistitem {Model Checking for Networks, a project to build tools to check if network policies are correctly enforced given a network topology and policy state for individual
elements.}
\eat{Network policy (for instance isolation policies implemented by firewalls or caching as done by web proxies) enforcement requires
a variety of middleboxes to act correctly in concert: for instance isolation policies require not just that firewalls be correctly configured but also require
that no previous middleboxes strip information required by the firewall. This project focuses on providing tools that given network topology and higher level
policies produce proofs that the policies are enforced or counterexamples where they are not.}

\cvlistitem {Network Consistency Models, applies the CAP theorem to SDN networks, and the minimal consistency model required to implement common
network policies.}
\eat{Network policies (from above) often depend on shared information (for instance the identity of the user associated with a particular
IP address). The CAP theorem indicates that in general distributed data stores must make a choice between consistency and availability in the presence of
failures (partitions). We investigate the implications of the CAP theorem on policy enforcement in SDN networks and also look at the weakest consistency model
required by a variety of network policies.}

\cvlistitem {Data Driven Connectivity, built an online algorithm that can ensure perfect connectivity in the face of arbitrary link failures at line rate.}

\cvlistitem {SDNv2, an architecture for networks where the network edge consists of software switches running on general purpose computers. We investigate how
to structure the control and data plane for these networks and new applications enabled by this architecture}

\cvlistitem {SMIRC, a project that looked at using secure multiparty computation (SMPC) for computing BGP routing information. SMPC allows us to centralize
computation without requiring ASes to reveal private policy information, speeding up BGP convergence without requiring ASes to change their trust model.}

\cvlistitem {Structuring SDN for Large Networks, we look at how to structure the control plane for large (geographically and in terms of number of devices) SDN
networks.}

\cvlistitem {BlinkDB, a distributed database engine capable of running approximate queries. BlinkDB is currently deployed at Facebook and other companies.}

\cvlistitem {Symmetry Breaking for Constraint Programming, looked at methods by which one could speed up solving constraint satisfaction problems. These
problems are widely used (for instance to schedule UPS delivery trucks and NFL games) and are susceptible to an exponential growth in time, particularly when
many equivalent (symmetric) solutions exist. }

\cvlistitem {Hierarchical Bayesian Networks, looked at producing tools for recognizing hand drawn figures using hierarchical bayesian networks that were
themselves inspired by the structure of the human visual cortex.}

\item Designed and implemented timer infrastructure for Midori. Midori relied purely on core-local time and allowed applications to specify a tradeoff between
time accuracy and performance.
